# cprompt
*This is incredibly stupid, by the way*

**cprompt** is a program to generate a zsh prompt from a C program as fast as
possible. I made this because I got annoyed when I `cd`d into a giant git
repository one time and my propmpt took 10 seconds to generate. I doubt this
will be much faster, but it will definately be much funner.
